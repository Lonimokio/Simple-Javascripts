### Filter_Hide

Filter_Hide is a simple script I made to hide certain filters and show others when the screen is too narrow. It is meant to unclutter a webstore on a mobile device.

To use Filter_Hide, simply include the script in your HTML file and initialize it by calling the `filterHide()` function. Here's an example:

```html
<script src="filter_hide.js"></script>
<script>
  filterHide();
</script>
